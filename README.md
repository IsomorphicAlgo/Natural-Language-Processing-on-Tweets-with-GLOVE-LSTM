# Text Analysis with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements deep learning techniques for text analysis, focusing on natural language processing tasks. The project is part of the DTSA5511 Deep Learning course curriculum.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing text entries with the following features:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each entry
- `keyword`: Keywords associated with the text
- `location`: Location information (if available)
- `text`: Raw text content
- `clean_text`: Preprocessed text
- `mean_words`: Average word count metric

## Project Structure
- `Week 4 - Text Analysis with Deep Learning Final Submission.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model implementation

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Key Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
